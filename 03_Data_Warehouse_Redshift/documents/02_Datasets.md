##Project Datasets
You'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

* Song data: ```s3://udacity-dend/song_data```
* Log data: ```s3://udacity-dend/log_data```

Log data json path: ```s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json```

##Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```text
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```json
{
  "num_songs": 1,
  "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", 
  "artist_latitude": null,
  "artist_longitude": null, 
  "artist_location": "",
  "artist_name": "Line Renaud",
  "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1",
  "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff",
  "duration": 152.92036,
  "year": 0
}
```
##Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```text
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.
